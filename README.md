# Hi there, I'm Harshana Liyanage 👋

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a dedicated software developer with a passion for creating tools that enhance data analysis and visualization. My work primarily focuses on developing applications that streamline workflows for data scientists and researchers.

## 🛠️ My Projects

Here are some of the projects I've developed:

- **[renv2pak](https://github.com/harshanal/renv2pak)**: A web-based utility that assists R developers in installing packages defined in an `renv.lock` file using the `pak` package. This tool serves as a workaround for issues encountered with `renv::restore()`, especially during environment migrations or complex dependency resolutions.

- **[R Libraries Parser](https://github.com/harshanal/r-libraries-parser)**: A simple JavaScript front-end application that parses R scripts to identify required packages and generates a comprehensive `install.packages` command. This tool simplifies the package installation process for R users.

- **[Epiviz](https://github.com/harshanal/epiviz)**: An epidemiological data visualization tool that provides easy-to-use functions for creating both static and interactive visualizations. It aids in the exploration and understanding of correlations between various genome features.

## 🤝 Contributions

I've also contributed to the following repository:

- **[epidm](https://github.com/alexbhatt/epidm)**: The Epidemiological Data Management package offers standard methods for processing epidemiological data in the UK. It focuses on key data assets, including infection data from the Second Generation Surveillance System (SGSS).
