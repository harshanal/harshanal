# Hi,  I'm Harshana Liyanage 👋

I'm a data scientist with a passion for creating tools that enhance data analysis and visualization. My work primarily focuses on developing applications that streamline workflows for data scientists and researchers.

## 🛠️ My Projects

Here are some of the projects I've developed:

- **[R Libraries Parser](https://github.com/harshanal/r-libraries-parser)**:Parse R scripts to identify required packages and generates a comprehensive `install.packages` command. This tool simplifies the package installation process for R users.

- **[Epiviz](https://github.com/harshanal/epiviz)**: An epidemiological data visualization package that provides easy-to-use functions for creating both static and interactive visualizations. It also includes Generative AI features to automatically generate narratives for visualisations using LLM APIs

## 🤝 Contributions

I've also contributed to the following repository:

- **[epidm](https://github.com/alexbhatt/epidm)**: The Epidemiological Data Management package offers standard methods for processing epidemiological data in the UK. It focuses on key data assets, including infection data from the Second Generation Surveillance System (SGSS).
